# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 1, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: today i learn html part of the odin project 1st module, emmet, form, form validation, svg, table, etc

**Thoughts** i just know about the plugins on vs that this whole time i've used without noticing it. emmet has its own cheat sheet if i want to revisit it later. also i know better about form html syntax from this article
